# Shellinator-3000
This repository contains the source code for my custom-built shell, called Shellinator-3000.

## Features
### 1. REPL
The Shellinator-3000 is implemented using a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which allows to program to wait for user input, evaluate commands and print appropriate output until the user enters 'exit 0'.

### 2. Built-ins
The Shellinator-3000 supports custom built-ins such as echo, exit & type.

### 3. Running a Program
The Shellinator-3000 is capable of executing any file passed to it, either as an executable, or as a path to an executable

### 4. Built-in Executable
The Shellinator-3000 can find any executable file at a given location, and execute it. Moreover, any commands (such as cat or ls) not built into the shell are still accessible. The shell also supports passing upto 20 arguements for any command.
